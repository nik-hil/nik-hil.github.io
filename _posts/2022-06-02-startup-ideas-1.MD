title: Startup idea: Suggest meme with AI
---


Personally, I would keep track of the latest memes and use the meme generator to create my content. But, 

1. If you could add a tool which would suggest a meme,  after giving a text or paragraph then it should be instantaneous hit.
2. For example if I am talking about recursion in programming then suggesting relevant existing memes with recursion would make my ppt very interesting.
3. This feature will be available to me like Grammarly.
